		<h1>Sarah Hall Web 110 Course Contract</h1>
		
		<p>
			I, Sarah Hall agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Summer 2019 WEB 110-85 Internet/Web Fundamentals with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
		</p>
		<p>
			I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Signed: Sarah Hall, May 21st, 2019
		</p>
		
		<h2>Workspace Setup</h2>

			Here is an embedded screenshot of my workspace setup. I've highlighted the important parts, and cropped and sized the image appropriately. Click the image for a link to the original. Both files are stored and named appropriately in my images folder inside this course's folder.
