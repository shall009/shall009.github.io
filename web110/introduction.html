			<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am 30 years old and I have a 9 year old son. I was born and raised in Charlotte, NC.</li>
			<li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I work for Charter Communications (better known as Spectrum). I am the Instructor for my department, which manages all Employee Accounts and Complimentary Accounts company-wide. I am responsible for training employees at both of our sites, located in Charlotte, NC and Newtown, CT.</li>
			<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I was half-way through my Associate in Communications when I decided to change my program of study to IT - Web Development. This is my second semester working toward this degree.</li>
			<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 10</li>
			<li><strong>Courses I’m Taking, &amp; Why:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>WEB 110-85: Web/Internet Fundamentals - I am majoring in web design and would like to become a web developer.</li>
					<li>ART 111-82: Art Appreciation - it was the only elective that I was interested in that was available this summer.</li>
					<li>COM 231-83: Public Speaking - I am required to take Public Speaking for my degree.</li>
					<li>CIS 110-06: Introduction to Computers - I took this class previously and got a lower grade than I would like. I am re-taking to get an A.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>Something to Remember Me By:</strong> I hate fruity desserts. I love fruit and I love dessert, but I hate fruity dessert. (Yes, even apple pie, strawberry shortcake, and banana pudding.)</li>
			<li><strong>I’d Also Like to Share:</strong> I am really excited to learn more about web development throughout this course!</li>
